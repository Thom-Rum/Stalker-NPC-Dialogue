        <text>The Zone has taken a heavy toll on me over the years, so I spend my final days here where it's quiet, but I would rather enjoy seeing my old friends once again.\nI fear Strelok and Guide may be dead, but I would very much like to speak with Fang and Ghost while there is still time. If you can find them and bring them here I would most appreciate your efforts.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_21">
        <text>How long have you lived out here? Fang and Ghost are legendary stalkers, but they're both long dead. Fang was killed by a mercenary named Scar in Army Warehouses, and Ghost was found underneath Yantar in Lab X-16 about a year later. Did you really not know?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_3">
        <text>They're both dead? Are you sure? I just... Oh alright... What is it that you want to know?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_31">
        <text>Really, now you'll tell me so easily? I feel you are just wasting my time, old man.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cit_doctor_main_dialog_4">
        <text>Wait! Don't go... I just didn't expect them to finish badly. When Strelok last came to visit, he gave me a key and coordinates to a stash in Pripyat.\nHe hasn't visited in years so I don't suppose he's fared much better. He was saying something about the Monolith, I didn't understand much of it and I'm not too sure he did either. Here, take it. One more thing... He spent a lot of time searching for clues of a conspiracy in underground labs, some kind of secret cover-up I believe. Perhaps you'll find your answers there.</text>

		<text>Me? I used to be a guide, believe it or not. I could lead a stalker to anywhere in the Zone. But that was a different time, before they found that damned Mercenary in the reeds with a mouth full of swamp water. That guy was so dim, every single day he'd forget the way in and out of the base, and I'd have to take him not more than a five minute walk just from here to the Fishing Hamlet and back! And then somehow, within only a few weeks he'd managed to talk our leadership and most of our men into an all-out assault on the nuclear power plant! Needless to say neither he, nor much of our faction, ever made it back from that madness. By the end of it I had nobody left to guide, but plenty of people to patch up. So here I am, now a medic. All because of that crazy fuckin' merc.</text>

	<string id="marsh_stalker_barman_background">
		<text>I'm the bartender. I serve drinks, food, and keep the radio playing. It's not an exciting job, but still preferable to being out in the field. Been working here for quite a few years now, got caught on the inside of the swamps when the emission hit so I was pretty much stuck here. Headed south like most people tried to but I was one of the few that didn't get picked off by bandits on the way. I searched out this base and joined up with Clear Sky. It was either that or die in a puddle somewhere. Spent the first few weeks as a grunt repelling the anarchists from our lookout posts and then got the job as the new bartender when Cold got promoted. Naturally I accepted, I'd rather be shooting drinks than bullets. But enough talk, how about a nice cold one?</text>

	<string id="marsh_stalker_trader_background">
		<text>Spore's the name, I took over this gig about a year ago. Came to the Zone looking for wealth like everybody does and ran into a stalker called Nimble. Found out we shared a lot of the same talents, both got a lot of outside contacts, good at trafficking goods in and out of the Zone, and selling info. So when the Monolith resurgence happened and business was driven south, we followed. Managed to land myself a nice job here after Nimble recommended me to Cold. He was a member of Clear Sky back in the day, y'know? Gives us both a nice little operation here, we have access to an army-free smuggling route through the swamps and Clear Sky gets first pick of everything we get our hands on. Pay Nimble a visit if you're ever in the Cordon, last I heard he was hanging out around the rookie camp. If you ever need a hard to obtain weapon or outfit smuggled in from the outside he's the guy who peddles the goods.</text>

	<string id="marsh_stalker_tech_background">
		<text>My name's Novikov, though some people call me Grey. When I first came to the Zone, I was hunting for artifacts just like everyone else, but my health was steadily declining until I realized I just couldn't do it anymore. Thankfully I've got a brain cell or two, so it wasn't difficult to find work. I spent about a year working for Clear Sky, before most of them died in a blind pursuit of some hazy goal. After that I spent some time wandering the Zone, and found some work with some scientists up in Jupiter. When my contract was up there, I heard that some of the remaining members of Clear Sky were starting back up operations in the Swamp, so I headed down here and joined back up with my old faction. I still keep in touch with some of the Ecologists. If you're ever looking for work, they're always looking for someone to guide them to the local anomalies. Talk to Spore about it if you're interested.</text>

	<string id="marsh_stalker_leader_background">
		<text>They call me Cold, I'm the leader of Clear Sky. I started out with Clear Sky as a bartender before the faction was decimated. The few of us that made it through quietly started trying to put the faction back together. I worked my way up through the ranks, a few guys ahead of me got killed, so now I'm in charge.</text>

		<text>We're what's left of a former group of researchers and engineers. Our faction was nearly destroyed under our previous leadership after we launched an ill-conceived assault on the Chernobyl NPP. We were trying to further the advancement of mankind through our work, instead we caused nothing but death and destruction. Now we strive to right was has been made wrong, and to collect the secrets of the Zone before they fall into the wrong hands.</text>
