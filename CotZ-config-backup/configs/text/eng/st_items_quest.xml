		<text>"Just some notes about old men's conspiracy theories". \nThere are rumours that the Agroprom Institute was used as a front for an unofficial lab in the years preceding the 2006 year accident. This lab hosted a number of very unusual experiments. The traders have dug up a lot of information about these laboratories. I met with the Barkeep, he says he sent Duty scouts to get into the underground vaults of Dark Valley, called X-18, but they disappeared. There are another rumours regarding a "Psi-Brain" mechanism. The whole neighbourhood in Yantar is under the influence of that piece of trash - it zombified everyone who came within range. There is another mechanism in Red Forest radar underground, called Lab X-19, and that's what is likely to be the Brain Scorcher. There is evidence to suggest that the presence of the Brain Scorcher intentionally blocks the road to the North, but no one knows exactly what it is. The Barkeep believes that the Brain Scorcher is man-made, and these mechanisms are not always operating at full strength. He thinks there are periods when their power is lowered to cool down the apparatus. It's time to visit all the underground laboratories in the Zone and find out what kind of secrets they are hiding. Too bad, that I'm too old for this shit. I wish Strelok would be still around, but damn, he disappeared years ago.</text>

More specifically under the concrete sarcophagus, also suggesting it may be their base of operations but with the intent to hide something. Reading further it states that they discovered laboratory hidden further in the north under the generators, however they were unable to gain access at the time of writing as they required the use of a decoder.</text> -->
		<text>The personal notes and reflections of an unknown stalker. Most of the pages are ripped out. The final entry reads: "Returned from the north. Mission failed. Lucky to be alive. Alive... My god, we're still alive. The source of the blowouts is not where we thought it was. But if not there, then where? Found what seems to be an electronic key to a sophisticated door lock, if I could find what it goes to perhaps I will have found the true source. I can't stop thinking all the answers lie in the Sarcophagus, but it has proven to be impossible to get in to. Too much radiation, too many Monolith... I have to go back. Alone this time. I must try one last time. It's our only hope."</text>

The notes allude to the nature of the tests that were being performed there; subjecting living organisms to biological experimentation, genetic alteration, and exposing them to the effects of some sort of psychic field. The details of the experiments are not clear from the notes, but the effects listed are horrific; severe physical deformation, hyper-accelerated genetic mutation, liquefaction of the brain tissue, acute necrosis of the flesh, and death. The last few pages seem to hint at a device that was being researched to counter the fields, along with some figures and diagrams.</text>

This newer emitter was far more powerful and did not rely on biological components to generate the psi-field. The initial tests are reported as being a massive success, however the report goes on to lament that a fundamental design flaw was causing the signal to degrade with time, prompting to the decision to cancel and decommission the project before it was fully completed. Mysteriously, the end of the report confirms that the emitter was indeed deactivated by the researchers before they abandoned the experiment. Who reactivated the emitter and why is unknown.</text>

The journal itself does not contain much in the way of useful information, however there is an intriguing scrap of paper tucked inside the back cover; an order of transfer of equipment and personnel to a new laboratory being constructed to the north of the reactor. A hand-written note on the order reads, "Boris, meet us at the new project location as soon as you return, coordinates attached." Interestingly, there is a date written on the note; "26-04-1986", the day of the original Chernobyl disaster, however the note appears to have been written much later than that.</text>
