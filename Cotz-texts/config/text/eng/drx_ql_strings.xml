Legend tells of a magical area hidden deep within the Zone, the only place in Chernobyl where you can find clear water, free from radiation. The Zone has imparted these waters with the ability rejuvenate a stalker, healing all wounds and ailments, even removing radiation poisoning from the body. But there is even more to it than that. The waters are rumored to also have brought into existence a very special artefact, one so unique and powerful that men would be willing to pay great riches to obtain it. Many have spoken about the Oasis, some even claim to have seen it, but so far, no one has ever found it. Maybe it is just a legend, but with all of the wonders I have seen here in the Zone I would not be surprised if it was true. If the Oasis really does exist, and if it does contain it's legendary artefact, whoever should find it first could become a very rich man.</text>

If you want to know how I did it, you will go north instead. Go to the Burnt Village and enter it from the road to the southwest. As soon as you enter the village there will be a field enclosed by a wooden fence on your right. Cross the field and you will find an opening in the fence on the other side; if you can see the Skadovsk in the distance you are going the right way. But be careful, the entire area is alive with fire. One wrong move and you will be burned alive. When you reach the opening in the fence you will be at the edge of a cliff. Close your eyes and envision yourself on top of the plateau. Believe that you are there, remove any thought that it is impossible. Once your mind is ready, throw yourself into the void.

		<text>I'm the pilot of a helicopter that crashed into the Jupiter Plant. There were several of us, we were the front end of a mission called "Operation Fairway". All of our helicopters experienced simultaneous failures and either crashed or had to perform an emergency landing. The few of us that survived gathered at this rendezvous point while we waited to be rescued. The Monolith cultists found us within a few days and overran the tunnel, taking us all hostage and using us as bait with the intent to slaughter the rescue teams when they arrived. When help didn't come, they started killing us off one by one. I was the last one left. They would have killed me too if you hadn't shown up when you did.</text>

		<text>I was part of a 5-ship flight in the operation, callsign "Stingray". We were to be the leading edge of a massive assault on the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. You see stalker, the situation at the center of the Zone is far more dire than anyone knows, including many people in the Military. The truth is, the Military has lost control of the Zone to a formidable and well-entrenched enemy. The Monolith are more than just a fringe cult, they are a full-out army that is well armed and far larger in number than anyone had ever guessed. They completely occupy the NPP and grow more powerful with each day. Operation Fairway was intended to eliminate the Monolith force and regain control of the heart of the Zone. Now that it has failed, I fear there is nothing left to stop the onslaught of the Monolith army.</text>

	<string id="drx_ql_pilot_interrogation_dialog_12351">
		<text>The electronics malfunctioned and they dropped straight into a swamp in Zaton. A few of the men survived the crash. They linked up with the survivors from Stingray 3 at a nearby barge. It was reported to me that the man who lived there was crazy as a loon; when the men tried to detain him, he tried to detain them! They made their way over here to the designated extraction point, the place we were supposed to be rescued from in the event of total mission failure, which this ultimately was. But help never came, at least not until you got here.</text>

	<string id="drx_ql_pilot_interrogation_dialog_131">
		<text>That's the scariest thing, man. We were flying along just fine, no issues, should have been a short flight to the LZ near the power plant. One of the guys on my flight had an anomaly detector on him - all of a sudden the thing starts going crazy, and then I lost all control of the aircraft. The crews from the other flights reported the same thing, we all simultaneously flew into an anomaly. What do you think the odds are of that happening, each of us hitting a separate anomaly at the same exact time? And look up; when was the last time you saw an anomaly form in the middle of the sky? It's like the Zone itself knew we were coming, and it swatted us down like flies.</text>

		<text>Are you kidding me? There's no way I'm going back to the Military. They sent us on a suicide mission and then couldn't bail us out when it went to shit! I've spent days as a prisoner, watching my comrades be executed one after another, wondering when it would be my turn. I've had enough of the Zone, I want to get as far away from it as possible.</text>

		<text>I can't continue to put my life on the line for this cause. This war is unwinnable, the Monolith are unstoppable monsters that will never be defeated. I've heard there is a stalker in the Pripyat Outskirts that has a boat. I'm going to find him and steal his boat and sail as far away from here as it will take me. Please don't try to stop me. The Zone has broken me, I can't take this place anymore. I just want to leave.</text>
