A Bandit came along and started watching them too. After a while, for no reason, he pulled out his rifle and shot one of them. He smirked, apparently satisfied he could still hit the broad side of a barn, and turned and walked away. Well, the other Flesh wasn't letting that shit pass, it ran right up to him and headbutted him into an anomaly. Zone karma.</text>
