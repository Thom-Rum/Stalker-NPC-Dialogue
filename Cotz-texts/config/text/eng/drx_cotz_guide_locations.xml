	</string>

	<!-- Cordon -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_1">
		<text>Cordon</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_1_text">
		<text>The Zone's antechamber - a jumping-off point for new stalkers entering the Zone for the first time. You'll find a trader in the vaults of the Rookie Village, just north of the Military Checkpoint. Don't miss the chance to talk to him. You'd be advised to steer clear of the checkpoint itself, however. You don't want the soldiers to catch a sight of you - most of them shoot first and don't bother asking questions later.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Great Swamp -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_2">
		<text>Great Swamp</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_2_text">
		<text>A vast irradiated marshland, the Great Swamp is an engineered reservoir of toxic waste and contaminated runoff from the Zone. Due to the inhospitable conditions, the Military has largely pulled back its presence in the area, relying primarily on helicopter patrols to defend the area. This has led the area to be identified as a potential weak point in the cordon, and many first-time stalkers use this as their entry point in their attemps to make their way into the Zone. There are few permanent residents in the area, although it is rumored the remaining elements of the Clear Sky faction have established a base there.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Darkscape -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_3">
		<text>Darkscape</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_3_text">
		<text>Darkscape is a large forest between Cordon and Dark Valley. While there are few reasons to visit, it is frequently used as a hideout by Loners and Bandits with a bounty placed on their heads.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Garbage -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_4">
		<text>Garbage</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_4_text">
		<text>A vast machinery graveyard. Right after the Chernobyl disaster whole heaps of radioactive waste were dumped there. Mostly ruins of old buildings infested with mutants. Much like the Cordon, the place swarms with rookie stalkers, with an occasional Bandit loitering around, always on the lookout for freebies. Going north, you will get to Rostok, east lays the entrance to the Dark Valley, with the road to the Agroprom Research Institute to the west.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Dark Valley -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_5">
		<text>Dark Valley</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_5_text">
		<text>Always gloomy, always misty and always rainy. Stalkers venturing into the Dark Valley are likely to find valuable artefacts, instant death, or both. A place frequented by some of the most experienced old-timers, though you may also stumble upon some common Bandits. There's supposed to be an underground lab around there somewhere, so it might be worth to look for a hidden entrance along the way. No one has returned from there alive though and no one can tell for sure just what nasty surprises await you there.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Agroprom -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_6">
		<text>Agroprom</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_6_text">
		<text>A strange, heavily contaminated area. Should you wander deeper into it, you will see a shallow lake, crammed shore-to-shore with abandoned equipment and other debris. You can also check out the abandoned Institute and the factory, though the Military have been hanging around there quite a lot recently.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Yantar -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_7">
		<text>Yantar</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_7_text">
		<text>The legendary lake in the sector of the same name dried up a long ago, leaving a shallow swamp in its place. The place is morbid and sodden with death. Great dangers await any adventurous soul foolish enough to get near it. Anyone who dares to go too far goes insane. Zombie drones are rambling around the whole sector, waiting for new victims. If you walk around the lake and past the zombies, you’ll end up at the scientists' camp, where the eggheads brought there by choppers are doing some research. You can have a chat with them; they buy artefacts and could even send you on a mission.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Truck Cemetery -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_8">
		<text>Truck Cemetery</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_8_text">
		<text>Truck Cemetery is a large graveyard of irradiated agricultural, civilian and military vehicles. As a great place to hide a stash, an eagle-eyed stalker may find many valuables among the wreckage.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Rostok -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_9">
		<text>Rostok</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_9_text">
		<text>The Duty faction have set up camp on the plain's edge and they always welcome stalkers in need of rest. A desert oasis of sorts - a place completely devoid of anomalies and mutants. Be sure to check out the 100 Rads bar in the vaults - it's a meeting point for stalkers from all over the Zone. The bar is run by the local trader, so if you're interested in selling or buying wares apart from the local gossip - that's the place to go to. North of the bar is the Army Warehouses, with the Garbage to the south.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Wild Territory -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_10">
		<text>Wild Territory</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_10_text">
		<text>The Wild Territory used to be the site of a rather large manufacturing plant, currently in ruins. Many stalkers met their death there: the place is swarming with all sorts of monsters. The beasts are literally streaming over there from the entire Zone. It is said that something of great importance is hidden at this site, so there are always plenty of daredevils willing to try their luck.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Army Warehouses -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_11">
		<text>Army Warehouses</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_11_text">
		<text>A deserted Cold War era military depot next to a dilapidated hamlet and a small marsh. The village is an eerie place literally swarming with mutants - the Bloodsuckers alone are legion. Stalkers do their best to keep away from it, even if it means going extra kilometers around it. The anarchists from the Freedom faction have settled down in the abandoned Army base. The road connecting the base to the Zone is guarded by the Brain Scorcher, which blocks the way to Pripyat and the Chernobyl NPP.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Dead City -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_12">
		<text>Dead City</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_12_text">
		<text>Once a thriving Soviet-era town, what is now known as Dead City was evacuated and abandoned in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster. Now crumbling in ruins, anything of value has been stripped and looted long ago, and it is now an empty shell that plays host to the almost constant battles between various factions that attempt to settle in the area, the most recent being the invasion of Mercenaries that have inexplicably arrived in the Zone.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Limansk -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_13">
		<text>Limansk</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_13_text">
		<text>Limansk is a mysterious ghost town that, according to those who believe the conspiracy theories, was once home to the researchers who were working on clandestine research experiments being conducted within the Zone. Now vacant and riddled with anomalies, Limansk is sporadically pockmarked by skirmishes that flare up between warring factions trying to gain control of one of the few remaining routes to the north. Towering over the northeast of Limansk is the massive Duga-3 Antenna Array; a Cold War relic that was once a top-secret defense installation, the "Woodpecker" is rumored to have actually been a large-scale experiment into transmitting mind-control signals.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Red Forest -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_14">
		<text>Red Forest</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_14_text">
		<text>Although it is the most direct way to access the north not blocked by the Brain Scorcher, very few stalkers have attempted the journey through the Red Forest. Those that have tried have either become hopelessly lost and perished, or turned back in terror, claiming the forest is haunted by monsters and supernatural entities the likes of which have never been seen in the Zone.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Radar -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_15">
		<text>Radar</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_15_text">
		<text>A dreadful place. Easy to vanish without a trace there, no matter how lucky you have been in life so far. The location is the site of a massive psi emitter known as the Brain Scorcher which prevents access to the north and effectively cuts the Zone in half. Whoever gets close to the Brain Scorcher immediately goes insane, turns into a zombie and starts stalking the Zone restlessly. A human shell is all that’s left. No one has ever returned with a sound mind.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Deserted Hospital -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_16">
		<text>Deserted Hospital</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_16_text">
		<text>The Deserted Hospital is an eerie catacomb that is the result of the structure being partially swallowed by a massive sinkhole that opened up below it. The few stalkers who have explored the area have reported that the area itself seems to illicit inexplicable and uncontrollable feelings of dread and unease so severe that they are compelled to turn back almost immediately. Those that do attempt to push through the ruins find themselves thwarted by the Monolith cultists that defend the area, dissuading most stalkers from using the Hospital as a viable route to the north.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Jupiter -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_17">
		<text>Jupiter</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_17_text">
		<text>The site of the Jupiter Plant and Yanov Station, Jupiter is a vast region that is almost completely deserted due to it being north of the Brain Scorcher, with almost no viable alternate routes to the south other than the almost certain death of trying to navigate the Red Forest. The only known inhabitants of the area, besides the packs of ravenous mutants and hordes of bloodthirsty zombies, are a small detachment of Ecologists that were airlifted in and supported by a reinforced mobile laboratory. It is rumored a small cell of Freedomers has survived in the area as well, trapped and cut off from the rest of their faction when the Brain Scorcher was switched on.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Zaton -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_18">
		<text>Zaton</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_18_text">
		<text>Zaton was previously a vast body of water that was a port destination for tankers and cargo ships. The entire area was drained in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster as part of the containment efforts. Gigantic rusting hulks of the grounded ships are now all that are left of the area. Zaton's adjacency to the Chernobyl NPP has made it a destination for desperate stalkers who mistakenly believe they can access the plant from the area, but are thwarted by terrain conditions that make crossing into the NPP from Zaton impossible. A stalker called Beard has set up camp in one of the shipwrecks, providing shelter and provisions for stalkers who survived the arduous journey north, only to find themselves at a dead end.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Outskirts -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_19">
		<text>Outskirts</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_19_text">
		<text>A large section of the eastern Outskirts of Pripyat is known to be outside the influence of the Brain Scorcher, however since the vast majority of Pripyat itself is shrouded by the lethal psi field, travel to the Outskirts is nearly impossible. There is an underground passageway that leads directly from Jupiter to the Outskirts, however it is highly contaminated and teeming with mutants and anomalies. Very few stalkers are known to have survived an excursion through the tunnels.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Pripyat -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_20">
		<text>Pripyat</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_20_text">
		<text>This used to be a town built for engineers working at the Chernobyl NPP before the 1986 disaster. Quite a big place once, it is a ghost town now with mutants and zombies as the only residents. There seems to be no way to get in there: the Brain Scorcher is blocking the way.</text>
	</string>

	<!-- Chernobyl NPP -->
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_21">
		<text>Chernobyl NPP</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_cotz_str_guide_2_21_text">
		<text>The site of the ill-fated Reactor #4 and the massive concrete Sarcophagus that now entombs it, this is the heart of the Zone. Little is known about the current status of Chernobyl NPP, the entire area has been completely inaccessible ever since the Brain Scorcher was activated. Many stalkers have been drawn to the Chernobyl NPP, believing it to be the site of a legendary object capable of granting any wish. None are known to have survived an expedition into the area.</text>
