		<text>I need some information.</text>

	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_1">
		<text>What do you want to know?</text>
	</string>

		<text>Tell me about Duty.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_111">
		<text>Duty is basically the police around here. Their objective is to clear the territory of mutants and destroy Freedom, which is what they are doing at the moment. They can be assholes to regular stalkers sometimes, but they are mainly just trying to keep the peace.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_12">
		<text>What do you know about the Freedom faction?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_112">
		<text>Freedom is one of the oldest groups in the Zone. They openly oppose the government troops and research teams. Its founders are dead, they were killed during a big bloodbath after the army dropped a large assault force into the Zone. Rumor has it there is some evidence that the Zone was once used as a secret army weapons testing site. Freedom is trying to stop the government from gaining control over the testing site again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_13">
		<text>Can you tell me about the blowouts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_113">
		<text>Emissions are especially dangerous and almost always fatal. You can feel one coming on gradually by the changing weather, but it passes soon after hitting its peak. At the first signs of its approach, run for the nearest cover - a cave, something made of concrete, bricks or steel. I can feel an emission coming on when my back starts to ache. As for the nature of emissions, I don't have anything useful to tell you, I just don't know.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_14">
		<text>Do you know anything about the Wish Granter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_114">
		<text>I can tell you the legend of the Wish Granter if you want, but it's up to you make up your own mind how much truth there is in it. Wanna hear it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_15">
		<text>Yes, tell me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_115">
		<text>This legend is about the Monolith, which may actually be what caused the Zone to appear. When the Zone exploded during the Second Incident in 2006, everyone was panicking. Nobody knew what was going on, the Zone was expanding and the field labs couldn't do anything about it! So the Military closed it off, tightened the cordon and left the Zone to rot. After a few years had passed, some reckless guys like you started to appear. They called themselves "stalkers". They started to sneak past army cordons believing that there are things in the Zone that would make them rich. Bit by bit, they brought out weird things, artefacts and oddities which eventually turned out to be very lucrative for them. Scientists and collectors went after them like crazy, they paid fantastic money for just one trinket from the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_16">
		<text>Go on...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_116">
		<text>After a while, the first tales and legends about what's deep inside the Zone by the crumbling NPP started to circulate. It all began when one of the veterans first told a story of the Monolith that allegedly grants your wishes. You should have seen the hysteria; experienced, level-headed men started trying to break through to the center of the Zone - everyone wanted something from the Monolith. We got some morbid details about the first stalker who made it through to the Monolith...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_17">
		<text>Go on, tell me more.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_117">
		<text>When the Zone first appeared many stalkers were trapped inside and cut off from the outside world. Most of them died pretty quickly, but there were a few lucky survivors who tried to do something about it. One of these survivors found himself by the NPP and noticed some strange light inside. With no way back he decided to try to get closer. He saw the broken roof of the Sarcophagus and the light coming out through it. He climbed up the wall and looked inside. Among the debris of metal and molten concrete there lay a massive black rock. It was the Monolith. The stalker came to his senses and realised that he had climbed right on top of the highly radioactive Sarcophagus! He was scared to death, but through the fear he could sense the Monolith calling to him. The Monolith spoke to him and he came to see strange, unbelievable things inside his head.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_18">
		<text>Wow.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_info_118">
		<text>I don't know what's true in this story and what's not, but the point is the guy made a wish that came true, and the Zone grew by 5 kilometers. It seems the Zone gobbles up more land for every wish that is granted. But that ain't gonna stop hotshots like you, trying to break through with their precious little wishes in their hearts.</text>

		<text>I have a few questions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_dolg_general_petrenko_stalker_info_1">
		<text>I'm listening.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_dolg_general_petrenko_stalker_info_11">
		<text>What can you tell me about this place?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_dolg_general_petrenko_stalker_info_111">
		<text>Before the accident in '86 this was an industrial area. As you can see, there ain't much left of it now. In the basement by the hangar you'll find the 100 Rads bar. The place is run by the local trader who doubles up as a barman. If you want to trade, talk, or find out the latest news, that's the place to go. There's also the Arena where you can fight and make some cash.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_dolg_general_petrenko_stalker_info_12">
		<text>Tell me about Duty.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_dolg_general_petrenko_stalker_info_112">
		<text>We've been here since the beginning. The first group was made up of the surviving members of special units sent into the Zone to find out what caused it to appear. We found ourselves in pretty dire circumstances. After half of the unit died horribly, those who survived swore that we wouldn't leave here until we understood what is going on in the Zone.. and defeated it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_dolg_general_petrenko_stalker_info_1112">
		<text>You want to destroy the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_dolg_general_petrenko_stalker_info_11112">
		<text>Yes. Meanwhile we manage it as best we can. During our cleansing operations, whole swarms of mutants on the way to the Zone's center are destroyed. We police the area and maintain safe areas for stalkers such as this. And we actively fight the anarchists who wish to unleash the Zone on the world.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_dolg_general_petrenko_stalker_info_13">
		<text>What can you tell me about Freedom?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_dolg_general_petrenko_stalker_info_113">
		<text>They're notorious nihilists, anarchists and criminals - freedom fighters, freaking guerrillas all of them. All they do is sabotage research groups, attack army units and constantly skirmish with us. They're thugs who don't understand that the Zone is an ulcer on Earth's body. They want to spread it all over the world, a piece in every household. They'll do anything to achieve that goal and I can't wait to put an end to it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_dolg_general_petrenko_stalker_info_14">
		<text>What do you know about the north?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_bar_dolg_general_petrenko_stalker_info_114">
		<text>I've heard stalkers claim there's a real treasure trove of artefacts in the center of the Zone, so anyone who makes it through will make enough money for two lifetimes. Then there are those that think there is something better than artefacts there - something that's not from this world, something alien or from another dimension altogether! They call it the Wish-granting machine, only every time someone makes a wish the Zone grows, and nobody who gets there uses his wish to make it disappear. I guess when you get to the Wish Granter you just don't give a shit about anyone else.</text>

        <text>Who do you have for me to fight?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_man_job_11">
        <text>So, your first fight? Your opponent is a piece of meat just like you. He's here because of his debts and he only has two options: to come out and fight, or to land himself in the nearest anomaly. He's gonna fight like a cornered animal. Equipment for today... Lemme think... How about you two use basic pistols, two boxes of ammo should be plenty. Either kick his ass or we feed you to the dogs - not much of a choice. Go on now.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_man_job_111">
        <text>I'm ready.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_man_job_112">
        <text>I'm not ready.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_man_job_12">
        <text>Your last fight didn't mean shit, you're still the same piece of meat you were before and no self-respecting person will bet a single mag on you. If you wanna earn some proper cash you're gonna have to make a few more appearances in the arena. Your new opponent also got through the first round, and his fight was a lot harder than yours. I don't like him, to be honest - he kills too quickly and the crowd doesn't like that. So, go and show us what you can do! The stakes will increase after this fight - all you gotta do is stay alive. Move it!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_man_job_121">
        <text>I'm ready.</text>

    <string id="bar_arena_man_job_122">
        <text>I'm not ready.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_man_job_13">
        <text>Well, well... You're not as much of a pussy as you first seemed. Now it's time to test you out in a real fight. You're up against two guys. The first one's called Swede and I don't remember the second one's name. They were paired up intentionally as they hate each other's guts so don't worry about them working as a team - they're more likely to shoot each other. Today is rifle day so don't let them get too close or we'll have to pick you up piece by piece. The odds are 10:1 so if you win you'll make a fair amount. Off you go!</text>

        <text>I'm not ready.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_man_job_14">
        <text>Well, now I can safely say that you're a fighter, a real fighter. Now it's time for a team fight. You get to fight with two rookies - two brothers - on your side. They haven't fought yet but they're brothers, so I had to put them into a team fight. I wouldn't expect any real help from them if I were you. You're fighting an experienced team, they're contenders for the final this season. A dangerous lot. They use different weapons but one has an automatic shotgun - be very careful with him. Good luck, pal... You're gonna need it.</text>

    <string id="bar_arena_man_job_141">
        <text>I'm ready.</text>

        <text>I'm not ready.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_man_job_15">
        <text>You've got a special fight today. Even the army has heard about you! Don't be surprised, they fight here too - there's even a general in the crowd. These guys are from the Spetsnaz or OMON. They're well armed and their armour is as good as you'd expect. Don't worry though, I ain't gonna leave you out in the rain, either. You'll get a vest used by Freedom - it's light so it won't slow you down. Go on, show them that stalkers ain't no whipping boys. Good luck!</text>

        <text>I'm not ready.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_man_job_16">
        <text>Time for you to show what you can do. Duty captured a group of bandits that had been causing problems for stalkers near Rostok. Duty took 'em at night so most of the bandits were taken alive. They were all gonna be executed anyway so I convinced Duty to give them a chance. If any of them survive, they'll go in the can outside the Zone, which is better than dying here. They're not well-armed - probably just a few pistols and sawn-offs - but there's six of them so watch yourself. Go on now!</text>

        <text>I'm not ready.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_man_job_17">
        <text>Well, you're almost in the final. Now you'll be fighting a real stalker. He's alone but he's got an assault rifle and he's inside an exoskeleton. Catch one burst and you're toast. There will be a surprise that I can't tell you about too... Here's my advice: be prepared, it's gonna be tough. The winner makes it through to the final. Fight to the death, go!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_man_job_171">
        <text>I'm ready.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_man_job_18">
        <text>Congratulations, you're in the final! One more to go and this one is to the death, every man for himself. There will be 4 other stalkers in the arena: all real pros in exoskeletons but it's a fair deal this time - you'll get exactly what they have. The only thing is, you don't get medkits or bandages in a fight to the death. Ready? Go prove you're the best, GO!</text>

    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_51">
        <text>Fat and short? Easy. I'll do it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_52">
        <text>I've heard all about those things. I'll pass.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_521">
        <text>He hardly reaches your waist in height. And he scares you?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_6">
        <text>Today is a special day. I don't know where they found... Him... But he's a real beast.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_61">
        <text>Deal. I'll put him out of his misery.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_62">
        <text>I don't feel like dying, find someone else.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_game_621">
        <text>Well, frankly even I find the beast scary. But I'm not fighting in the arena, so who cares?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_0">
        <text>Got a couple of questions.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_1">
        <text>Shoot.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_10">
        <text>Never mind.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_11">
        <text>What is this establishment?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_111">
        <text>This is the arena, my little business. A place where stalkers can test their mettle and earn their fame by fighting against the horrors of the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_12">
        <text>How do you get the mutants here?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_121">
        <text>We made a deal with Duty, instead of killing all the mutants they find they bring the weaker ones here in exchange for cash. Duty gets paid, the mutants get killed, and then I get paid. Everybody wins.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_13">
        <text>Where are you from?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_info_131">
        <text>I am from many places. I heard about this little backwater and understood that I could earn a good little penny here. So here I am.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_0">
        <text>What are the rules?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_1">
        <text>Oh, the rules are pretty simple. I invented them myself. For challenges, there's a cage, and a mutant is let inside the cage. You pay money and tell me the time you need to kill the monster. If you make it - you win, if you don't - I win.\nBut for the main course, bandits and the Zone's other degenerates captured by Duty fight in the arena for their crimes. Some are just stalkers who fancy a fight, and not actually criminals, but whoever leaves the arena in the least amount of pieces gets a sizeable reward. If they keep on winning fights, then more stalkers will come to watch, and the combatants win larger rewards.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_11">
        <text>Good to see you stalker, welcome to the arena.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_21">
        <text>So, what are you waiting for? Get into the cage.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_31">
        <text>Sorry, there's nothing to fight against yet. Wait for a day or two until we can catch a new mutant.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_41">
        <text>There you are! Well done! Here's your win. If you desire another fight for money then just drop in whenever.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_arena_manager_start_51">
        <text>Sorry, bro, but you lose. Come again next time if you want.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_start_dialog_11">
        <text>Oh, hello. What's up?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_start_dialog_12">
        <text>What do you need, stalker?.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_start_dialog_13">
        <text>You here to buy some shit?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="bar_visitors_stalker_mechanic_start_dialog_1">
        <text>Hey guy, how goes the Zone? So...I hope you have repair work that needs done... Heh, I need some cash bad.</text>
