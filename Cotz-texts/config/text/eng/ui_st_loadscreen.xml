		<!-- <text>Rank has eight different levels starting at 'Rookie' and finishing at 'Legend'. It can be increased through almost any in-game activity, and certain features may require reaching a high rank before they can be used.</text> -->
		<text>The Zone is a living organism. It chooses who it allows inside of it and when. To survive in the Zone, you must learn to respect it, learn to listen to it, and learn to never trust it.</text>

		<!-- <text>Achievements can be unlocked through certain in-game accomplishments or by reaching statistical milestones. Every achievement is unlocked with an appropriate reward which can be viewed in the PDA.</text> -->
		<text>Blowouts are deadly emissions that occur regularly in the Zone and are believed to emanate from the heart of Chernobyl NPP itself. While no one has yet located their true source, it is known they are more intense and come with less warning the further north you go. Seek shelter immediately when one approaches.</text>

		<!-- <text>Basic, advanced and expert tools are required by most mechanics in order to perform certain upgrades on weapons and outfits. Such items can often be found in stashes received as rewards for completing tasks.</text> -->
		<text>The Zone is full of anomalies; small pockets of space and time where the known laws of physics seem to break down. These bizarre quirks of reality can be awesome to behold, but are deadly traps to stalkers caught unaware. They move and shift throughout the Zone, disappearing in certain areas and appearing in others whenever there is a blowout.</text>

		<!-- <text>Sleep deprivation is an optional feature where the passage of time and using consumables will gradually drain the player - eventually requiring them to rest when prompted. Failing to do so may have dire consequences.</text> -->

		<text>Be aware of the amount of noise you are making when you are in enemy territory, even your footsteps can give away your position.

		<!-- <text>Gunsmith and sewing kits are used to repair your weapons and outfits respectively when out in the field. Each allows up to three uses and are best used to repair items of greater value than the kits themselves.</text> -->
		<text>How the Zone itself came into existence is not yet fully understood. Some claim the prolonged exposure to the extremely high levels of radiation created the Zone, while others believe in a supernatural or otherworldly intervention. Still others suspect the phenomenon is man-made, the result of secret experimental research projects that went awry.</text>

		<!-- <text>Backpacks can be bought or found and then used to create a custom stash. Stashes created by the player are never de-spawned nor are they ever looted by other stalkers. They are permanent until all items are removed.</text> -->
		<text>Artefacts are small crystal-like substances that are unique to the Zone and thought to be produced within the altered physics of an anomaly field during an emission. There are several different types, each of which have properties that can be beneficial or harmful to the user. They are highly desirable and some of the more rare specimens can command a high price from a willing buyer.</text>

		<!-- <text>Sleeping bags are a great way to rest in the Zone if you are unable to find a decent bed to sleep in. They can be purchased from most major traders or potentially found in another stalker's stash.</text> -->
		<text>Radiation poisoning is the most insidious and omnipresent threat in the Zone. Pay attention to your geiger counter and alway carry some sort of protection against exposure. Seek treatment immediately if you become contaminated.</text>

		<!-- <text>Truck Cemetery is a large graveyard of irradiated agricultural, civilian and military vehicles. As a great place to hide a stash, an eagle-eyed stalker may find many valuables among the wreckage.</text> -->

		<text>Although Pripyat itself is inaccessible due to its proximity to a massive psi field, travel to the eastern Outskirts is still possible through an underground passageway that runs beneath Pripyat. The entrance to the tunnel can be found in Jupiter.</text>
