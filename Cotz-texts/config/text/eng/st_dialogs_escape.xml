	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_trader_info_0">
		<text>I have a few questions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_trader_info_1">
		<text>Ask away.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_trader_info_11">
		<text>What can you tell me about the Military?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_trader_info_111">
		<text>No one really knows whether they're guarding the Zone or protecting the rest of the world from it. Sometimes they send whole expeditions here to look for something. But I'll tell you this; they don't respect the Zone, and the Zone doesn't like them either, that's why they often return home in body bags. They have no respect for stalker rules and won't even help you if you're dying right in front of them. They'll gladly shoot you themselves though, and they don't get reprimanded for that. I've got a few contacts among them; you know, people always need vodka and... umm, magazines, right? Don't annoy them - they'll whack you for nothing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_trader_info_12">
		<text>Tell me about the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_trader_info_112">
		<text>The Zone... Well, you see, it's not just a circle a few kilometers in diameter with a nuclear power plant in the center. It's something bizarre. Really bizarre. I doubt anyone in the world could give you a straight answer. I feel the Zone isn't even part of this world. It's a different, detached world, weird and dangerous... and attractive, too. And you know why? Because with a little luck anyone can get rich quick. And the closer you come to the center of the Zone, the higher you will climb on the money ladder.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_trader_info_121">
		<text>What are the dangers here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_trader_info_1121">
		<text>Where to begin? You can croak any second around here and not know what hit you. A dumb soldier's bullet is the least of your problems, although they've pulled in a lot of Military here. Getting shot is basically the most painless kind of death in the Zone. Anomalies, now that's something for you. To die in an anomaly is a terrible thing indeed, even mutants try to keep away from them. By the way; mutants, these "children of the Zone", are another kind of trouble, so don't go anywhere unarmed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_trader_info_13">
		<text>How does one get rich around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_trader_info_113">
		<text>Artefacts, that's the most important thing here. They are worth a fortune in the Big Land. Artefacts are more precious than gold, diamonds or pure plutonium. Why? Because no jewelry in the world can give you the supernatural powers that the artefacts possess. Just imagine: you can hang a little gadget on your belt that makes bullets swerve by and never hit you! If you are good, you can even find artefacts right around here. For the most valuable pieces though, you'll have to get closer to the center of the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_trader_info_14">
		<text>Does anyone know what's happening in the center of the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_trader_info_114">
		<text>It's a different tale every time you hear it. It's a bunch of fairy tales, I don't believe all that otherworldly nonsense. The one thing I do believe is that the center of the Zone contains a lot of valuable artefacts. Only I haven't met anyone who went there and managed to come back alive.</text>

		<text>What can you tell me about the area?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_info_1_1">
		<text>About three kilometers north of here you'll find the Garbage. That's the place they used to dump all the radioactive waste from the Chernobyl disaster. High radiation levels, anomalies all over the place, so there are loads of artefacts to be found there, but not very valuable. Just beware of the gangs and don't cross the Duty patrols. West of the Garbage is the former Agroprom Research Institute. Little there in terms of artefacts so you can skip it. And to the east, there's the Dark Valley. That's a pretty weird place. It seems quiet enough, apart from a bunch of gangsters roaming around. But I got a feeling there's more to it than meets the eye. Oh, and there's the Rostok factory right beyond the Garbage. That's stalker territory. You'll find lots of clued-up folks there, they'll tell you the rest.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_info_2_0">
		<text>What kinds of mutants are around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_info_2_1">
		<text>More kinds than I'd like. Flesh, Boars, Blind Dogs, Pseudodogs, Snorks, Tushkanos... we even get sightings of a Bloodsucker every now and again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_info_2_11">
		<text>Tell me about Boars and Flesh.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_info_2_111">
		<text>Flesh are the most harmless of mutants. They try to stay away from stalkers, but they'll fight back if you attack them. Now, if there's a Boar among those Fleshes, that spells trouble. Three hundred kilos of rage is nothing to toy with. Try not to stand in its path as it charges at you, and use its momentum against it. Dodge to the side, a heavy bulk like that won't be able to turn on a dime, then plug it full of shot.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_info_2_12">
		<text>Tell me about Blind Dogs and Pseudodogs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_info_2_121">
		<text>Lone canines aren't that dangerous, but packs of them are a real pain in the ass. They only attack if they're hungry; the bad thing is, they're almost always hungry. If you're up against a whole pack try to pick them off from a high spot, or else they'll just run you over. Watch out if there are mature Pseudodogs amongst them. Pseudodogs ain't much tougher than the blind ones, but they're much more cunning and dangerous. If one suddenly turns into a whole pack, then remember: you’re being attacked by phantoms. The real Pseudodog will hang back and only try to bite you now and again. Try to identify it. As soon as the real dog is dead, the phantoms will simply disappear.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_info_2_13">
		<text>Tell me about Snorks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_info_2_131">
		<text>Remnants of humans. A lone Snork isn't much of a problem for an experienced hunter. You wait for him to jump at you, and pump him full of shot in the air. If there's a group of them however, you're in a heap of trouble. They know this and that's why they usually attack together. You've gotta just shoot at them as fast as you can while dodging their jumps.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_info_2_14">
		<text>Tell me about Tushkanos.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_info_2_141">
		<text>A hunter's nightmare. The worst thing you can do is underestimate Tushkanos because of their small size. They're incredibly fast, agile and always run in packs. When you feel dozens of small fangs tearing into you, that's when you stop underestimating and start shooting, but by then it's too late. And that's the scariest part, they're extremely hard to hit. That's why I always tell stalkers to carry a loaded shotgun.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_info_2_15">
		<text>Tell me about the Bloodsuckers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_info_2_151">
		<text>They're expert hunters themselves, with an excellent disguise. When they're camouflaged you can barely see them. If you are unlucky enough to run into a few Bloodsuckers, always watch your back. Remember, a Bloodsucker will try to sneak up behind you and weave its feelers around your neck. That's some creepy shit, man. If you're hunting a bloodsucker, try to startle it. You can see it better when it's on the move.</text>

	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_fanat_info_111">
		<text>I used to work in a mine before they closed it down. I had no money and nothing to look forward to. Then I heard some rumors about the fabulous riches hidden inside the Zone. I had some experience under my belt, so I thought, "What the hell?". Can't say I've become rich, but some cash came my way, that's for sure.

	<string id="drx_ql_str_dialog_esc_2_12_stalker_fanat_info_113">
		<text>Hard to say. There are so many dangers and surprises, you just can't run into all of them. There's more than enough for one person anyway. I got one toe bitten off, my hair is falling out from the radiation, and half my leg got fried in a Burner. Things here are real bad. I once happened to come face to face with a Bloodsucker - there's a meeting I'd like to forget. We can talk all you like, but you'll never know until you experience it on your own.

I know for a fact there's lots of ways to kick the bucket in the center of the Zone, and I don't believe in the Wish Granter anymore. Don't take that risk. I wouldn't.</text>

I made some useful connections working for him and was able to branch out on my own, delivering exclusive orders. I have no desire to bust my ass for pennies anymore.

		<text>Just a sec. Here's a modular FT-200M rifle, the brainchild of Belgian gunmakers. Accurate, all-purpose, handy for both righties and lefties, comes with an optical scope and a grenade launcher. I got it from some unlucky UN observers... That'll be 16,000 extra.</text>

		<text>Here's Tide. Based on a silent sniper rifle, it was specifically designed for military units to fight zombies. Tide yields rate of fire in favour of stopping power, allowing the sniper to pick off zombies one by one without disclosing his location. However, it then became clear that stalkers alone will be enough to stop zombies at the Barrier, so the rifle never reached mass production. This baby's yours for an extra 16,000.</text>

		<text>Here. This is an SVU2-A, a short sniper rifle with an increased rate of fire. I bought it off Mac, the legendary Freedom guard. He swore there are no others like it in the whole Zone. It's an exclusive item, at least in these parts. It'll be 16,000 extra.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_422">

		<text>Sure, just look at Lynx here.  Hand-crafted by a local expert. He's deceased now, so there won't be any copies. It looks just like any other rifle, but take it out for some target practice and you'll feel all the difference. It's got a perfect combination of accuracy and stopping power. Add the remaining 16,000 and this baby's yours.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_432">

		<text>Look here. I managed to get everything off my list - a CS-3a with a helmet. The helmet is nothing special on its own, but it allows for installing a mobile tactical complex, which includes a high-quality night vision system and an active infrared sensor. Now, the CS-3a armour is a real beauty. Excellent protection from bullets and anomalies is a rare feature indeed in a suit as light and mobile as this one. The whole thing will cost you 32,000.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_512">

		<text>Specially for you, a SEVA suit. Everything just like you ordered - a closed-cycle respiratory module, thermal resistant, protective electrical circuit, and outer-surface anti corrosion materials. Plus several built-in artefact containers as a bonus. A must-have suit for any stalker. Toss in 24,000 like we agreed and it's yours.</text>

		<text>There it is, a combat exoskeleton as large as life. The best protection you can get in the Zone from bullets, claws or grenade fragments, with the exception of armoured vehicles. But it also takes after armoured vehicles in that it relieves your weight burden - within reason, of course. 48,000 and it's yours, warts and all... err... by that I mean batteries and servomotors.</text>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_112">

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_132">
